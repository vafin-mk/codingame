 	The Goal

At CodinGame we love inventing new games but developing a game requires a lot of work. We need to agree on the rules, implement a referee to determine whether a solution is correct or not, develop the graphics engine and finally test the game itself. In order to keep improving CodinGame we need to increase the size of our team.

This time, we won't do the graphical part. We won't even bother telling you what the inputs are. It's up to you to understand what you need to do in order to achieve the best possible score.

We will also participate in this challenge, do you think you can beat us?
